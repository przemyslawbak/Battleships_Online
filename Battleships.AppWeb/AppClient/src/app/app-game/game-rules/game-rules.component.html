    In Battleship, an armada of battleships is hidden in a square grid of 10Ã—10
    small squares. The armada includes one battleship four squares long, two
    cruisers three squares long, three destroyers two squares long, and four
    submarines one square in size. Each ship occupies a number of contiguous
    squares on the grid, arranged horizontally or vertically. The ships are
    placed so that no ship touches any other ship, not even diagonally.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of the puzzle is to discover where the ships are located. A grid
    may start with clues in the form of squares that have already been solved,
    showing a submarine, an end piece of a ship, a middle piece of a ship, or
    water. Each row and column also has a number beside it, indicating the
    number of squares occupied by ship parts in that row or column,
    respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Variants of the standard form of solitaire battleship have included using
    larger or smaller grids (with comparable changes in the size of the hidden
    armada), as well as using a hexagonal grid.
